Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.  Things happened! It was snowy and sunny at the same time. 

Then, one day, something very, very big happened. 

He opened his door and outside his door was a huge hulking beast! Neadless to say, 
the beast was stunned!

The person that opened the door was a cute little penguin wearing a brown coat and a grey hat that looked
up at the beast. 

The penguin froze and waited for the beast to make a move. The beast opened its mouth, the penguins shook at the sight of it's
sharp teeth.

The penguin was taken aback. "What large teeth you have!" he procaimed. "Have you ever heard of tic tacs? Your breath smells horrible!".
